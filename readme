The agenda of the project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the Super Store's sales and profits. 
The project includes the following steps:

1.)Data loading and exploration: Load the dataset and explore its structure.

2.)Data cleaning: Handle missing values and drop unnecessary columns (e.g., 'Postal Code').

3.)Descriptive statistics: Calculate summary statistics for the dataset.

4.)Identify loss-making segments and products: Isolate data where profits are negative ('loss_df').

5.)Total loss calculation: Calculate the total loss incurred by the Super Store.

6.)Group-wise analysis: Analyze loss-making segments, sub-categories, cities, and categories.

7.)Visualizations: Create informative visualizations to understand sales, discounts, and segments.

8.)Correlation analysis: Calculate the correlation between numeric columns and visualize it using a heatmap
